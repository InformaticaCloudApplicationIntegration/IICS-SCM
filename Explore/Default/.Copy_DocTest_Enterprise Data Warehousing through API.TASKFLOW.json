You would be receiving files from different geographies to write to central DB. The mapping logic is consistent for all geographies. The mapping is parameterized to take source value as a parameter. Taskflow can now be invoked with a list of source parameters and be looped over the mapping by passing one source value at a time.\n\nOnce this is done, user would call a subtaskflow that provide analytics based on customer input coming through the API request",
